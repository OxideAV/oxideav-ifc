//! Phase 3: tessellated-geometry extraction.
//!
//! Phase 1 ([`crate::parser`]) gives a positional instance graph and
//! Phase 2 ([`crate::schema`]) names the attributes of the spatial /
//! product slice. This module turns the *geometric representation
//! items* a product points at into plain triangle meshes — the first
//! Phase-3 slice covers the two tessellation entities:
//!
//! * **`IfcTriangulatedFaceSet`** (`Coordinates`, `Normals`, `Closed`,
//!   `CoordIndex`, `PnIndex`) — a list of triangles, each a triple of
//!   one-based indices into a shared point list (ISO 16739 §8.8.3.47 /
//!   IFC4 EXPRESS `IfcTriangulatedFaceSet`).
//! * **`IfcPolygonalFaceSet`** (`Coordinates`, `Closed`, `Faces`,
//!   `PnIndex`) — a list of `IfcIndexedPolygonalFace` records, each a
//!   convex polygon of one-based indices; this module fan-triangulates
//!   every face (§8.8.3.39 / IFC4 EXPRESS `IfcPolygonalFaceSet`).
//!
//! Both face-set kinds carry their vertices in a shared
//! `IfcCartesianPointList3D` (`CoordList : LIST OF LIST [3:3] OF
//! IfcLengthMeasure`) reached through the supertype attribute
//! `IfcTessellatedFaceSet.Coordinates`. The optional `PnIndex` adds one
//! more one-based indirection: a `CoordIndex` value *i* selects
//! `PnIndex[i]`, which is then the one-based row of the point list
//! (§8.8.3.47, "Use of PnIndex").
//!
//! The output [`TriMesh`] is std-only (no framework dependency), so it
//! is available in `--no-default-features` builds. The `registry`
//! decoder lifts it into an `oxideav_mesh3d::Scene3D`.
//!
//! Alongside the index-based tessellations this module also evaluates
//! the **faceted boundary representation** family, whose faces are
//! explicit polygons of `IfcCartesianPoint` references rather than
//! indices into a shared list:
//!
//! * **`IfcFacetedBrep`** / **`IfcFacetedBrepWithVoids`** — a manifold
//!   solid whose `Outer` (and, for the …WithVoids subtype, each `Voids`)
//!   is an `IfcClosedShell` (§8.8.3.18 / IFC4 EXPRESS
//!   `IfcManifoldSolidBrep.Outer`).
//! * **`IfcFaceBasedSurfaceModel`** (`FbsmFaces : SET OF
//!   IfcConnectedFaceSet`) and **`IfcShellBasedSurfaceModel`**
//!   (`SbsmBoundary : SET OF IfcShell`, the SELECT of
//!   `IfcClosedShell` / `IfcOpenShell`) — collections of shells.
//!
//! Each shell (`IfcConnectedFaceSet.CfsFaces : SET OF IfcFace`) holds
//! `IfcFace`s; every face's outer `IfcFaceBound` (the `IfcFaceOuterBound`
//! when present, else the first bound) carries an `IfcPolyLoop` whose
//! `Polygon : LIST [3:?] OF IfcCartesianPoint` is triangulated — convex
//! single-bound loops by a fan, concave loops and faces with inner
//! (hole) bounds by projecting onto the face plane (Newell normal) and
//! ear-clipping hole-aware, so face holes stay open. The shared vertex
//! table is de-duplicated by `IfcCartesianPoint` id so a point
//! referenced by several loops contributes one mesh vertex (§8.8.3.18:
//! "each Cartesian point shall be referenced by at least three poly
//! loops"). Per-bound `Orientation` flags ARE applied — a FALSE bound
//! contributes its loop reversed, so a closed shell's effective
//! windings yield consistently outward normals (face-orientation
//! digest §2).
//!
//! Beyond the face-set / Brep families this module also sweeps the
//! linear **swept area solid**:
//!
//! * **`IfcExtrudedAreaSolid`** (`SweptArea`, `Position`,
//!   `ExtrudedDirection`, `Depth`) — a 2-D profile area swept along a
//!   direction by a depth into a closed prism (§8.8.3.15). The profile is
//!   resolved to its outer ring from an `IfcArbitraryClosedProfileDef`
//!   (`IfcPolyline` outer curve) or an `IfcRectangleProfileDef`
//!   (centred `XDim`×`YDim`, with an optional 2-D `Position`), then a
//!   bottom cap, a `Depth · ExtrudedDirection`-offset top cap, and a
//!   side-wall quad per profile edge are emitted and re-placed by the
//!   solid's optional `Position` `IfcAxis2Placement3D`.
//!
//! It also resolves the **mapped item** instancing entity:
//!
//! * **`IfcMappedItem`** (`MappingSource`, `MappingTarget`) — the
//!   inserted instance of a source `IfcRepresentationMap`'s
//!   `MappedRepresentation`, meshed in its own frame, lifted into the
//!   map's `MappingOrigin` `IfcAxis2Placement`, then placed by the
//!   `MappingTarget` `IfcCartesianTransformationOperator`
//!   (2D / 3D / 3DnonUniform — orthonormal `IfcBaseAxis` columns scaled
//!   by `Scale`(`/Scale2`/`Scale3`), translated by `LocalOrigin`).
//!   Mapped items may nest (a source representation can contain further
//!   mapped items); recursion is bounded by a depth cap.
//!
//! Swept-solid profiles are resolved as full areas ([`ProfileArea`]):
//! arbitrary closed profiles (polyline or full-circle outer curves,
//! with or without voids), rectangles (plain and hollow), circles
//! (plain and hollow), and ellipses. Caps are triangulated hole-aware
//! (hole bridging + ear clipping), so concave and holed profiles mesh
//! correctly; hole side walls are emitted for hollow / voided profiles.
//!
//! Boolean results (`IfcBooleanResult` / `IfcBooleanClippingResult`)
//! compose at the surface-mesh level: UNION merges the operand
//! boundaries; DIFFERENCE with a **half-space tool** genuinely carves —
//! the first operand's closed mesh is split against the half-space's
//! plane set (`IfcHalfSpaceSolid`, prism-restricted
//! `IfcPolygonalBoundedHalfSpace`, box-restricted `IfcBoxedHalfSpace`)
//! and every cut cross-section is re-capped watertight, per the
//! `AgreementFlag` side convention of the half-space clipping digest;
//! INTERSECTION with a plain/boxed half-space clips to the solid side.
//! A non-half-space DIFFERENCE tool still falls back to the first
//! operand's boundary as authored; general mesh–mesh INTERSECTION is
//! surfaced as `Unsupported`.
//!
//! Profile boundary curves cover arcs: `IfcTrimmedCurve` over a
//! circle / ellipse / line basis (Cartesian and parameter trims,
//! `SenseAgreement`, `MasterRepresentation`, model plane-angle unit
//! applied to parameter trims), `IfcArcIndex` three-point arc segments
//! in `IfcIndexedPolyCurve`, full `IfcEllipse` boundaries, and
//! `IfcCompositeCurve` chains with per-segment `SameSense`.
//!
//! **`IfcSweptDiskSolid`** (and its `…Polygonal` subtype) sweeps a disk
//! or annulus along a 3-D directrix (polyline, indexed poly-curve with
//! line/arc segments, trimmed or full circle, composite curve):
//! parallel-transported ring frames, exact elliptical mitre junctions
//! at path corners, end caps on open paths and seamless wrap on closed
//! ones — pipes, rods and rebar mesh watertight.
//!
//! **`IfcSectionedSolidHorizontal`** lofts a series of profiles placed
//! at distance-along stations of a 3-D directrix (the IFC 4.3
//! infrastructure solid): sections are kept **level** (profile +y →
//! global +z, +x → the horizontal lateral direction), lateral /
//! vertical station offsets apply, and sub-stations are interpolated
//! at every directrix vertex so the loft follows the curve.
//!
//! The **CSG primitives** (`IfcBlock`, `IfcRectangularPyramid`,
//! `IfcRightCircularCone`, `IfcRightCircularCylinder`, `IfcSphere`)
//! mesh with their per-primitive anchoring (block/pyramid by base
//! corner, cone on its base centre, cylinder and sphere centred), and
//! `IfcCsgSolid` evaluates its tree root. Any Boolean DIFFERENCE /
//! INTERSECTION whose tool tessellates to a closed **convex** mesh
//! (a primitive, an extruded convex profile, …) carves through the
//! same plane-splitting path as the half-space family.
//!
//! Still later Phase-3 work (reported as [`GeometryError::Unsupported`]
//! rather than silently dropped): the other swept solids
//! (`IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid`, the tapered subtypes), the named
//! parameterised profiles (I/L/T/U/Z/C shapes), advanced/curved breps
//! (`IfcAdvancedBrep`, `IfcFaceSurface`), and general mesh–mesh
//! boolean subtraction / intersection.
